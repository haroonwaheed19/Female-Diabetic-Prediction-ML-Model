Diabetes Prediction using SVM

This project applies Machine Learning (ML) to predict whether a person has diabetes based on medical data. The model is trained using Support Vector Machine (SVM) with the SVC classifier to achieve high accuracy in classification.

📌 Features

✅ Preprocessing & Feature Scaling for better model performance

✅ Support Vector Classifier (SVC) for classification

✅ Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy

✅ User-friendly Interface for predictions (Optional Flask Integration)

📂 Dataset

The model uses the PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset, available on Kaggle.

    🔢 Total Samples: 768
    🎯 Features: 8 medical parameters (e.g., Glucose, BMI, Insulin, Age)
    ✅ Label (Outcome): 1 = Diabetic, 0 = Non-Diabetic

🛠 Tech Stack

    Python, Pandas, NumPy
    Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
    SVM (Support Vector Machine) - SVC
    Flask (For API deployment, optional)

🚀 How It Works

1️⃣ Load and preprocess the dataset

2️⃣ Train the model using SVM (Support Vector Classifier)

3️⃣ Evaluate the model using classification metrics

4️⃣ Deploy the model for real-time diabetes predictions

This model helps in early diabetes detection with high accuracy. 🔍
